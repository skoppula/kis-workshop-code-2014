Introduce chi-square:
	What is chi-square testing? M&M activity
	Application to biology:
		Determining linkage
		Determining if gene expression profile matches
			Is there a smarter way to do this?
			Compare against all cancer patients in the world?
			Doesn't actually give us insight into what genes are significant?

Biology is high-throughput: lots of data about lots of genes
We need a way to automate processing all this data.

*three-part series on systems, quantitative, computational biology*

1. feet wet: automatic Punnett square creation
2. From pedigree guess what type of disease
3. Chi-square testing for cancer
